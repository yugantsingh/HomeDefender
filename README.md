# HomeDefender: Object Detection using ESP32 Camera Module

HomeDefender is a project that receives a video feed from an ESP32 camera module and processes the incoming feed to classify objects. It was developed as a minor project for university curriculum and uses the ESP32 camera module to transmit the video feed over WiFi.

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Easy to use and set up
- Uses an ESP32 camera module

## Requirements

- ESP32 camera module
- Google Collab

## Installation

1. Set up the ESP32 camera module to transmit the video feed over WiFi.
2. Run the code to start processing the incoming video feed.

## Usage

To use this project, simply power on the ESP32 camera module and wait for it to start transmitting the video feed. The detected objects will be displayed on the serial monitor.

## TODO
